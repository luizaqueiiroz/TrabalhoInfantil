            The Institute for Research and Child Protection (IPPI) is an organization dedicated to combating child labor in Brazil.
             Founded with the purpose of raising awareness about the negative impacts of child labor and seeking solutions to eradicate
              it, IPPI operates on multiple fronts, always focusing on the well-being and future of children and adolescents.

Our mission is to fight child exploitation through research, education, and the implementation of public policies that ensure children's
 rights, guaranteeing that they can fully enjoy their childhood with access to education, healthcare, and a safe, protected environment.
  We work in partnership with governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as communities, aiming to promote structural
   changes in society.

Additionally, IPPI is committed to collecting data, conducting research and studies, and disseminating information about child labor in
 Brazil. This effort seeks to raise awareness in society about the severity of the issue and the fundamental rights of every child. In
  doing so, we aim to contribute to mobilizing the population and building a fairer society where all children can grow up in an 
  environment that fosters their holistic development and protection.
